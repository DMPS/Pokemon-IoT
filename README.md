# Pokemon-IoT
Bringing your favorite RPG into the world of IoT

Programming is hard. That is why we get paid the big bucks to do it. Yet a fraction of the programming jobs available are filled. The situation is even worse in the IoT sector. We need to train people faster.

That's why I created Pokemon IoT. A Unity SDK for building your own IoT connected Pokemon games. It helps both young and old learn an emerging technology through something they already liked.

Technologies used: NodeJS, Unity3D, PubNub, Intel Edison, Node Red
